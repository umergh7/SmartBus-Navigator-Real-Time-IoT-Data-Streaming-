# TTC-End-to-End-Data-Pipeline

This project is dedicated to the creation of a real-time data pipeline for the analysis of Internet of Things (IoT) data generated by buses. Our approach involves employing a comprehensive array of tools that span from the backend API, Apache Nifi, MySQL, Change Data Capture (CDC), Kafka, Spark Streaming, Hudi, Amazon S3 buckets, Athena, to PowerBI. This seamlessly integrated pipeline serves the purpose of converting raw data into actionable insights, thereby empowering data-centric decision-making and fostering the expansion of business operations.
